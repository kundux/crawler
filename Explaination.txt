With more time following could be done:

1. Security can be added in API(Most Important)
2. External/static URLs can be checked in better and efficient way
3. Better error handling for each level of exception with readable response
4. Efficient and fast url validation code
5. Optimized url processing code
6. IP Rotational algo can be used to prevent blocking of search engines and websites
7. Record of processed urls can be keep in data base instead of collection

2. If depth is higher, API response can be slow
3. Search engines or particular websites might be blocker from same IP address
